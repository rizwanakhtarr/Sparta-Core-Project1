# Sparta-Core-Project1

### Description

The goal was to create Simon says game using JQuery, Html and CSS. We had a week to do this

#### Installation
Having the existing folder where all my JQuery, CSS, Html files were created. I created a new repo on Github called Sparta-Core-Project1. Next in my terminal I did git init to init followed by git add . and then git commit -m "" to message my changes. git remote add origin git@github.com:rizwanakhtarr/Sparta-Core-Project1.git was what I used next on terminal to create a link form Github to my local files.Finally by doing a git checkout -b dev I created a dev branch to push all my work up to. ( which was the git push origin dev in my terminal). Each Feature I created on the files. I would create a new branch for and as soon as It was okay I could merge it onto the dev branch which later could be merged on the master which was the main.

### Challenges
The main challenges I found with my game was to understanding JavaScript concepts such as arrays, functions, loops and putting them together which in order to do required a good understanding.

The second challenge was to make it fully responsive. The content in the middle with the 'start' and 'reset' button needed to stay in the middle of the four divs even if you decrease or increase the browser.

Finally another challenge I found was with the arrays. When Randomised the colours generated in the loop I had to link this array to the user input so the same sequence that was generated by the colours would be identified when the User clicks the same sequence. If the User is correct the message will show in the middle saying 'winner' and if incorrect it will say 'error'

### code snippet

JavaScript

```
//Hide and Show Instruction after clicking
  $("#hide").click(function(){
        $("p").hide();
  });
  $("#show").click(function(){
        $("p").show();
  });

  var colorSequence = [];
  var round = 0;
  var randomSelections = [ '#0' , '#1' , '#2' ,'#3']
  var randomColors = [
      'red',
      'green',
      'yellow',
      'blue'
    ]
  var playerSequence = [];

  $('#start').click(function(){
  colorSequence = [];
//Generates Random Number from the random Colors array

    for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      var index = Math.floor(Math.random() * randomColors.length);
      colorSequence.push(randomColors[index])
    }

```

The above code created JavaScript to make a random number generate the colour

Html

```
  <div class="container">
      <div class="square green" id="0" > </div>
      <div class="square red" id="1" > </div>
      <div class="square yellow" id="2"> </div>
      <div class="square blue" id="3"> </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <div class="controls">
      <div class="title">Simon </div>
      <div class="box1" id="rounds">00</div>
      <div class="box2 inline" id="start" >Start</div>
      <button class="box3 inline" id="reset">Reset</button>
    </div>
    </div>

```
This code above was for the layout of boxes with the start reset button code

```
box3 {
  border: solid 2px black;
  border-radius: 30px;
  width: 55px;
  height: 55px;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 12px;
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
}

button {
  border: solid 2px black;
  border-radius: 30px;
  width: 70px;
  height: 55px;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 15px;
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  }

```

The final part of the code just styled the elements in the html with colours and layout.
